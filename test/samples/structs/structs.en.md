## Subject

This will generate a program reading structs.

### Input

The input will contain:

- On the first line, separated by spaces, an integer (a field), and an integer
  (a field): **struct**, a struct 1 instance.
- On the next line, an integer: **n**, a number.
- On the next lines, a list of **n** elements: **struct list**, a list a struct
  1.
    - One line per list element: separated by spaces, an integer (a field), and
      an integer (a field).
- On the next lines, a list of **3** elements: **triangle**, a triangle.
    - Each list element is on several lines: a struct **point**.
        - On the first line, a char: **name**, the point's name (single
          character).
        - On the next line, separated by spaces, an integer (X), an integer
          (Y), and an integer (Z): **pos**, the point's position.

### Output

Look at them structs.
