## Subject

This reads several kinds of list.

### Input

The input will contain:

- On the first line, an integer: **N**, the first list's size.
- On the next line, a list of **N** integers separated by spaces: **list int**,
  a list containing ints.
- On the next line, an integer: **size**, an other size.
- On the next line, a list of **size** chars next to each other: **list char**,
  a list of char.
- On the next line, a string of size **20**: **string**, a string.
- On the next lines, a list of **size** elements: **list string4**, a list of
  strings of size 4.
    - One line per list element: a string of size **4**.
- On the next lines, a list of **size** elements: **matrix**, a matrix of int.
    - One line per list element: a list of **size** integers separated by
      spaces.

### Output

Aren't these lists beautifull?

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ (list int)[ ] ≤ 2000
- 0 ≤ size ≤ 5
- (list char)[ ] ϵ {f, o}
- 0 ≤ matrix[ ] ≤ 3456

### Performance constraints

- 0 ≤ matrix[ ] ≤ 10000
